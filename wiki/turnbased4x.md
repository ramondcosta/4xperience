# Intro

You are the general, you should "push" as far as you can with the help of you comanders(capitains?)/units and heroes.


start with main settlement

# Fight

units walk together folowing the comander. 
any adjacent army will reinforce their ally if they choose to
units in a battle can be wounded or killed, but who looses a fight also looses al his non-comander units

## fight map
- Deployment zone
- ranged units cant shoot if there an enemy in adjacent title
- explosive attacks causes a percentage of the damage in the adjacent titles 
    - the size and the percentage changes depending on the attack?
        - it may be a 1(common)/2(uncommon)/3(pretty rare) titles of range
        - 33/50/66% damage
- if a cavalry unit is at 3 title of strait distance of a target without have any obstruction(terrain or unit), it can charge that target, giving an extra bonus damage with the possibility of stun the target

# Economy

- global base gold income
- global base mana income

## resources
- gold: the main way of pay your soldiers and buildings
- mana: used in magic, the creation of some building and upkeep of certain special units
    - every army has a mana reserve which can be filled when in own territory by taking it of the global reserve 

## earn resource
- economic buildings
    - buildings can give a base income 
        - but also improve other resources collections?

- after wining a battle the winner takes a loot of gold and items; the stronger the enemy the better the loot
- mana harvesting
    - magic items can be "garrisoned" in certain buildings and their magic harvested, adding mana to your global reserves every turn 
- some charachters may give aditional global mana per turn 
- capitains and heroes can raid enemy lands and earn gold. The local populace may fight back a raiding party
- Trading can be stabilished with other warring groups?
- Selling of magic items


# Cities

The warring organization start with a city and can expanding their realm by occupying others or creating their own.

## city creation

Use a certain part of a city population and create settlers
the city need to be tier two or more and have enough extra pop

## zone of influnce

All cities hold a zone of influence, that grows as the population grows, new cities cannot be founded in such zones

## city tier

After passing a certaing threshold a city upgrades a tier 

## buildings

### military buildings
There are only two military buildings that can be constructed, the headquarters and the arcane center

The arcane center is for any mana related units: some monsters and hero mages
The headquarters build create any other miitary

As the tier buildings increases, the military can be recruited, improves.
Tier 2 military buildings allow the creation of capitains and heroes.(but heroes may need specifi techs or archievements to be recruited)

<!-- how many tiers?
could it increase as the organization unlock units? without a specific max? -->
# growth
- base growth
- "food buying" - see decrees
- fertility
- "rituals"
    - certain rituals can improve city growth

## decrees
- food buying
    - the player can use this decree to improve city growth, to the cost of gold
    - How much gold can be expent, depends on city wealth(gold income per turn)

## economic buildings
- the bigger the pop the bigger effects
- agriculture: effects increase based on terrain fertility(titles of the influence zone), builds automatically, increases pop growth
- market: trade agreements with other organization increases the value earned
- mining: needs mineral titles(increases industry value)
- industry operations()
    - As technology advances more gold is earned(it also increases market money)
- mana node(needs tier 2 city)
    - base mana value increase every turn(depending on pop size?)
    - garrison magic items to harverst mana, every item gives a different value

## defense buildings

- garrison camp: as it grow, stronger is the city defenses

## garrison

all cities have a base garrison which has no upkeep and that garrison can upgraded by updating the "garrison camp" building

armies(parties/militias included) can also garrison in a city  
<!-- should it include a max cap for cities -->
<!-- garrison armies should pay less upkeep(probably)? How much less? -->

## Fort cities(WIP)

# Rituals and Spells

Using the global mana the organization can use rituals and spells to:
enhance settlements and armies;
damage or cause negative effects to enemy armies and settlements

to use them there need to be a mage or a node close to the target
